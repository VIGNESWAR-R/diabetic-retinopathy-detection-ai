# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection-AI
# 🧠 Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from Retinal Images

This project aims to automatically detect the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning models such as CNNs and Vision Transformers. It includes a web interface for easy image upload and prediction.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Flask (for web app)
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

## 💡 Features
- Retina image classification into 5 DR stages
- Image preprocessing and resizing
- CNN + ViT model comparison
- Flask-based web interface with login/signup
